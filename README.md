# Project Description

This is a software engineering team generator command line application which runs in Node. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. 
The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.The prompt will ask for the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

A screenshot showing an example user input is shown below:

When all the information of the team member has been entered, the user is asked whether there are any more members they would like to add. 
If the users respond with 'yes', then same questions are asked for new team member. Else a HTML file is created with cards displaying the information on all the team members entered by the user.
